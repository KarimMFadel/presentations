### 1. Distributed Systems (A Real-World Ride-Sharing Platform Journey)

**File:** `distibutedSystem/distributed-systems.html`

**Overview:**
A comprehensive introduction to distributed systems concepts using a real-world ride-sharing platform 🚗 (like Uber) as a case study. This presentation walks through the fundamental challenges of building scalable, reliable systems across multiple cities.

**Topics Covered:**
- **Definitions & Characteristics**
  - What is a Distributed System?
  - When and why to use Distributed Systems
  - Real-world examples (Uber, Google Maps, Netflix, WhatsApp, Instagram, Banking Apps)
  - Challenges and trade-offs in distributed systems

- **Basic Concepts**
  - Nodes and State (Compute + State)
  - State Machine Replication (SMR)
  - Distributed Logs and event sourcing
  - Quorums and Majority voting
  - Data replication strategies

- **Consensus Algorithms**
  - Introduction to Raft Consensus Algorithm
  - Leader Election
  - Log Replication
  - Key concepts: Terms, Elections, Majority consensus
  - Fault Tolerance and Byzantine failures

- **Real-World Application**
  - Journey from single server to distributed architecture
  - Handling scale (1000s of simultaneous rides)
  - Consistency models (Strong vs Eventual Consistency)
  - Fault tolerance in practice

**Key Learning:**
- How distributed systems solve real-world scalability problems
- Why consensus algorithms are critical for data consistency
- Trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance
- Practical implementation patterns used by major tech companies
